# KIKULACHO

This page is a dummy website used to train and test my HTML skills after week 2 of software engineering.

It's for a fictional restaurant located in Nairobi that specialises in Kenyan dishes.

It includes examples for centering tables horizontally, vertically, and aligning content within cells.

The website is created using HTML only.
